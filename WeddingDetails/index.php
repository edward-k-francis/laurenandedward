                                Second line parade is unique local expression of the New Orleans culture. The parade traces its roots back to the 19th century. This custom was brought about by the city’s famous jazz funerals. Organizations began hosting parades to honor those who have died. Traditionally, the parades include a brass band, street dancing, and wardrobes of brightly colored suits, hats, and bonnets. The term ‘second line parade’ refers to those joining in its excitement. We encourage our guests to celebrate with us by wearing hats, masks, and boas.
