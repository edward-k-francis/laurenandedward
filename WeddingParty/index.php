                                My younger sister, Kelsey is an independent and sassy younger sister. Throughout the years, I’ve enjoyed playing, laughing, fighting, and singing without a tune. As children, I remember playing school, I was always the teacher and she was the student (misbehaving in class). Over the years, we our relationship and friendship grew closer when we both attended the same high school and college. While at Rockhurst University, I convinced her to go through recruitment and was ecstatic when I found out that she joined my sorority (Alpha Sigma Alpha)! She has been a constant support throughout my life. Whenever I need a shoulder to lean on, I know that she will listen and offer kind words while finding positive aspects in any situation. I am blessed to have her as my younger sister.

                                Affectionately known as "Murray", we met during our freshman year at the University of Iowa in our Biomedical Engineering classes. We got to know each other better during our sophomore year when our class schedules were almost identical. We started sitting next to each other in every class and hanging out with each other every day after class. We would even get up early to stand in line to get front row seats at Hawkeye football games. Matt and I have had some great memories: trips to bowl games and other random places, FAC, being roommates. We remained close even after he moved to Memphis for optometry school and then back to Iowa to start his career. I could not imaging getting married without him next to me.

                                Maggie has been my good friend since sophomore year of high school. We first became friends while sitting in the hallway waiting to go to homeroom. Our friendship grew deeper when we starting working together at the IcePlex selling candy, sport drinks, and soda. During the summers, we made many bucket lists. These items included: Frisbee, picnics, and concerts. While away at college, we enjoyed sending each other Hallmark cards through snail mail. Thank you for being a friend I know I can count on and a buddy to travel with.

                                We became friends during our sophomore year of high school. We often spent Friday nights baking cookies, playing card games, attempting to dive off diving boards, or skating on skates. During the summer, we spent time sitting in her driveway or getting a sonic drink/ice cream. I’ll always remember the times spent together discussing our life goals and what we would do when we grew up. I know that I can rely on Jill to consistently hold me accountable in achieving and obtaining my goals.

                                Julie was my co-worker on Sunday afternoons at Houlihan’s Restaurant. We spent many hours at work discussing our dreams and hopes in between serving tables. When I moved back to Kansas City, she was kind enough to let me live with her while attending graduate school at Rockhurst. When I moved back to Kansas City, she was so reliable that she was willing to unload a U-haul; she assisted by jumping in without any hesitation. Our time together includes singing aloud, dancing, and cooking. Julie is a friend who is willing to tag along with any adventure.

                                When Sarah was residence assistance at Rockhurst, I often visited her while getting a sugar fix from her candy supply in her dorm room. During our sophomore year, we enjoyed attending sorority dances, playing games, and watching an occasional episode of Grey’s Anatomy. Our friendship bloomed when I moved back the Kansas City. While in KC, we often took evening walks, cooking, and getting frozen custard at Foo’s. Sarah was kind enough to let me borrow her eHarmony accounts which lead to my relationship with Edward. I am forever grateful for her encouragement with online dating.

                                We were both in freshman choir at Marian High School; however, my career ended early when I dropped the class. Our friendship grew deeper in our junior year of high school while hanging out with a mutual group of friends. While in high school we were both in the musical: Meet Me in St. Louis and The Boyfriend. I know I can always count on Michelle to sing aloud (even if I mix up lyrics), dance, or bake. Throughout college, we occasionally visited each other; she attended Kansas University. I am enjoying sharing our ‘new’ hometown of Kansas City.

                                Tess and I became friends while volunteering for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in New Orleans. We bonded discussing everything under the moon. We enjoyed exploring the city of NOLA, learning the heritage, and deepening our friendship. She is from San Francisco and taught me the culture of a west coast native. Following our departure from NOLA, we decided to run the half marathon in KC together. I enjoy listening, laughing, and learning from my sincere friend.

                                Elena is my cousin. I will never forget when Elena was young and visited us for the first time. The Spittler siblings were so excited to have a younger cousin. I spent a great amount of time that visit holding, feeding, and playing with her. It has been a pleasure to watch her grow over the years. She has turned out to be a talented gymnast, prestigious student, and sweet young lady.

                                Chris and I met at the University of Iowa in our Biomedical Engineering classes. We start hanging out after a party Matt and I had for a class project. After that party, I knew Chris was a good guy and a lot of fun to hang out with. Chris, Matt, and I as well as our friend Brendan were affectionately named "The Half Ton of Fun" by our friend Samantha. Chris and I spent a lot of time together during my fifth year of college. We spent a lot of time watching or playing football. We've been on bowl game trips in Florida and Texas together, have had memorable New Years Eve nights, and many nights playing card games. Even after moving to Chicago and getting married, we have kept close and make sure we get together at least once a year.

                                My brother is hands down the only groomsmen I've known their whole life. Even though we used to fight as kids and he got me in trouble a lot, we've come to terms and enjoy hanging out together now. During the summer when our family would head to Texas, Christopher and I were the only boys there. So we spent a lot of time playing at our grandfather's house while the girls were off shopping. Christopher and I were both involved in swimming, church, and Boy Scouts while growing up. We both earned the rank of Eagle Scout while members of Troop 104 in Blytheville. We even went to the Boy Scout National Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia in 2001.

                                Chris and I were roommates in Kansas City for three years. We met in June 2007 when we started at Cerner together. If Chris and I were not home, we were belly up to the bar at Kelly's Irish Pub in the Westport bar district of Kansas City. We lived within walking distance of the bar so we would go just to hang out. When we moved to the plaza to make room for Yuan, we still would hang out in Westport. Chris and I have gone to a couple Hawkeye vs Cyclones football games. Although Chris is a Cyclones fan, I have accepted him. He has been a very generous friend and even his family took me in when I needed a place to stay. Chris was very persuasive in talking me into signing up for eHarmony where I met Lauren.

                                Yuan and I also met in June of 2007 on our first day at Cerner. Yuan and I started hanging out more after he started sleeping on our couch instead of driving home. After multiple months of that, Hagan and I decided to find a three bedroom apartment to force Yuan to pay rent. Yuan was also instrumental in me meeting Lauren. We have spent many nights hanging out at the apartment until he moved to London. During those two years, we still talked regularly. When he needed a place to stay after coming back, I let him move into the other room at the house.

We've had some crazy time together, especially when we hung out in Manhattan, KS for New Years Eve. We thought we were going to die of frost bite that night. Even though Chris is hardly around during the week, you can almost expect a text message about hanging out on the weekends. If I ever have a tech question, I go to Chris. He was able to fix Lauren's laptop when it seemed like all hope was lost. I can always trust Chris to be there if I need him.

Aaron and I met through Chris Schmidt, but I'm sure if we didn't meet through Schmidt I would eventually have met him. Aaron has the knack for meeting people, more than anyone I've ever known. Aaron actually had a friend who's boyfriend was a college friend of Lauren's. Aaron and I love to get our hopes up about the Royals. We've been to a lot of games together, including a couple opening days. There have been some great times together; kickball, softball, float trip, trivia.

We've had some crazy times together going to Memphis for random things like wrestling matches, boxing matches, and Redbirds' games. After becoming a police officer and now a state trooper, I've had the opportunity to join him on middle of the night ride alongs. Brandon's wife Jennifer and I were neighbors as kids and have known each other a long time.

Lauren and the other volunteers ended up moving into the opposite side of a duplex that Justin previously lived in.
